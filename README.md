# mlops-covid
My capstone project for the MLOps Zoomcamp


There is a README.md file in each folder with instructions.
The order is the following:
1) EDA: if you want to see some basic EDA on the covid dataset
2) exp-track-mod-reg: with the Experiment tracking and Model Registry in MLflow
3) deployment
4) deployment_PrefectRemoteAgent
5) monitoring
6) deployment+monitoring
7) testing
